# Find The Thing

This repository contains source code for a maze-like browser game which uses a recursive nearest-neighbor percolation method to produce maze levels with increasing difficulty. Music and sound effects are compatible with modern versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

If you are on a non-mobile device with a keyboard (i.e. desktop or laptop), you can [play the game here](https://dsshen.github.io/find-the-thing/)!

## Scenario

A thing is hidden in a field. But, oh no! The field is full of holes.

Find the thing without falling into a hole!

## How To Play

Use your keyboard's WASD or arrow keys to move. Every time you find a thing, the field will reset and 5 seconds will be added to the countdown timer. The more fields you clear, the harder the game will get. If you fall into a hole or if the timer runs out, it's game over.

See how many fields you can clear!
