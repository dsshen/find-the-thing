# Find The Thing

This repository contains source code for a maze-like browser game which uses a recursive nearest-neighbor percolation method to produce playable levels that progressively increase in difficulty. Music and sound effects are compatible with modern versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

If you are on a non-mobile device with a keyboard (i.e. desktop or laptop), you can [play the game here](https://dsshen.github.io/find-the-thing/)!

## Scenario

A thing is hidden in a field. But, oh no! The field is full of holes.

Find the thing without falling into a hole!

## How To Play

This is a fast-paced game. Every time you find a thing, the field will reset and 5 seconds will be added to the countdown timer. The fields will grow progressively harder over time. If you fall into a hole or the timer runs out, the game will end.

See how many fields you can clear!
